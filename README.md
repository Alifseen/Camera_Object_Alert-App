# Webcam Alert App
Whenever someone enters the view of the camera, it captures the image, and sends it as attachment via an email notification. 

There were a lot of concepts that were applied in this application when it comes to image processing, such as thresholding, dilating, contours, and frame manipulation.

On top of this, there was a fair amount of algorithm building to be able to send the middle most frame as an image in an email once the object was out of frame. 

We also learn the concept of threading in Python.
